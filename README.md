# EFFECTIVE-PLANT-MONITORING-ROBOT
## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
During crop cultivation, one of the major factor affecting the production is plant diseases.It        reduces the production yield, affects the cultivators financially and sometimes leads to wastage      and scarcity of food
## RESEARCH FINDINGS 
It is Concluded that the productivity is affected by a quarter due to diseases in plants which affects the livelihood of small marginal farmers economically. Thus it is proposed to use Machine
Learning in the problem. The machine learning finds a significance application modern cultivation. The disease can be detected in the plants and the infection can be restricted about 22 percentage. The machine learning can be implemented with low cost also it is effective. The cost efficient implementation is feasible to every small scale farmers, as Indian small scale farmers prefer systems and tools with low cost as they can afford it easily.
## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
* Chassis – The base of the design on which the parts and components are mounted. Also to withstand the forces and loads.<br/>
* Arduino – The microcontroller which is used to connect the drives and motors to run the robot.<br/>
* Raspberry Pi – The microprocessor which is used to predict the disease using camera and sends the feedback to the server.<br/>
* Ibt – 2 Hbridge – The motor driver module used to connect between Arduino and motors.<br/>
* Raspberry Pi camera module – The device used to sense the plants.<br/>
* Motors – The prime mover of the robot used for motions which is a DC motor.<br/>
* Battery – The power source of the robot design.<br/>
* Ultrasonic sensor – The sensor used for detection of obstacles so that effective autonomous motion is achieved.<br/>
## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
* Solidworks
* Arduino IDE
* TensorFlow
## CONCEPT DIRECTION
The various modern technologies and tools were studied for the effective solution of the problem. The Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning and Electronic Controllers were chosen for the solution product design. The factors that influenced the selection of the tools were efficiency, modern culture, cost effectiveness,availability, reliability and feasibility. The Major and important in this design is the usage of cloud data to the robot. The conventional machines like pesticide sprayer reduces the problem effectively with less cost but it also reduces the quality of the yield.To overcome the demerit, the solution we have proposed is the only effective method.
