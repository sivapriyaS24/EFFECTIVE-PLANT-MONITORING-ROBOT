# EFFECTIVE-PLANT-MONITORING-ROBOT
## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
During crop cultivation, one of the major factor affecting the production is plant diseases.It        reduces the production yield, affects the cultivators financially and sometimes leads to wastage      and scarcity of food
## RESEARCH FINDINGS 
It is Concluded that the productivity is affected by a quarter due to diseases in plants which affects the livelihood of small marginal farmers economically. Thus it is proposed to use Machine
Learning in the problem. The machine learning finds a significance application modern cultivation. The disease can be detected in the plants and the infection can be restricted about 22 percentage. The machine learning can be implemented with low cost also it is effective. The cost efficient implementation is feasible to every small scale farmers, as Indian small scale farmers prefer systems and tools with low cost as they can afford it easily.
